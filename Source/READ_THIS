heya! before you click that .bat file, you may want to check some things before running.

it seems this is your first time installing this program, so ill give you a small run down.


Settings.JSON controls the bot, you can modify everything except for the "version" string, as it uses it to auto-update itself, and contains your current version..
SubredditList.TXT are the subreddits the bot should post in.
Message.JSON are the options for the post, we currently don't have the option to pick flairs, it is reccomended to not post in flair-required subreddits.
.log contains errors and setup information, when things go wrong, you can check in there.
